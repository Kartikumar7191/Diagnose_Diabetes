# Diagnose Diabetes using Machine Learning

## 📌 Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can classify whether a person has diabetes based on their medical records. The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which includes features such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, age, and insulin level.

## 🧠 Objective
Use supervised machine learning to create a classification model that accurately predicts diabetes diagnoses to assist in early detection and prevention.

## 🧪 Methodology
- **Dataset**: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (UCI Repository)
- **Preprocessing**: Data cleaning and standardization using `StandardScaler`
- **Model**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix
- **Tools Used**: Python, Google Colab, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib

## 📈 Results
The trained model achieved good performance in predicting diabetes with a high accuracy score and balanced precision/recall values. A confusion matrix and classification report were generated for better insight into performance.

## 📸 Output
- Confusion matrix heatmap
- Accuracy and classification report
